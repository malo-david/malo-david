## About Me

Final-year student at ENSAE Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris), specializing in Finance, Risks & Data.
My academic and project work combine stochastic calculus, econometrics, and numerical methods with experience in derivative pricing, risk modeling, and quantitative/machine learning–based portfolio optimization.

Currently, I am conducting a research project at CMAP - École Polytechnique, developing a new stochastic model for integrated variance to generalize the Heston framework, using SPX and VIX data for volatility modeling, pricing, and calibration.

I am actively seeking a quantitative finance or structured products internship where I can apply rigorous mathematical frameworks and high-performance code to tackle real-world financial challenges.

## Technical Skills

**Programming**: Python, R, C++, SQL

**Quantitative Finance**: Derivative pricing & hedging, stochastic volatility modeling, Levy and GARCH processes, risk management, portfolio optimization

**Machine Learning**: Regression, time series forecasting, CNNs, non-linear prediction

**Tools**: Git, Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Matplotlib

## Selected Projects

**NMF**: Research project focusing on the implementation of NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) and Deep NMF and the study of their implicit regularization (low rank bias).

**CPP–Pricing-Using-EDP**: Pricing tool for European options under the Black–Scholes PDE, designed for future extension to American and exotic derivatives with numerical schemes (FD, Monte Carlo).

**PY–PriceTracker**: Web scraping and data analysis tool to estimate market inflation dynamics based on real-time price data.

**PY–Swap-Puzzle-Solver**: Collaborative algorithmic project implementing BFS and A* search with a GUI to solve logical puzzles efficiently.

**SAS–Profession-Impact-On-Happiness**: Econometric analysis on how profession and partner’s occupation influence happiness levels, using regression modeling and statistical inference.
